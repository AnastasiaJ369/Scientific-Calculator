TI-30XS Scientific Calculator

With HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS! This is an expansion of the basic calculator we've all started with with further exploration into JavaScript static mathods and properties!
I'm still working on the functionality of some buttons such as "ln", "log" and "x^2." I don't expect all buttons to be functional such as the 2nd or mode buttons. Instead,
I plan to replace some buttons that are only available in 2nd with buttons that are displayed naturally such as getting rid of the "table", "data" and "prb" buttons. 

I hope to have this project finished before the new semester begins!
