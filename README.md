TI-30XS Scientific Calculator

With HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS! This is an expansion of the basic calculator we've all started with with further exploration into JavaScript static mathods and properties! 
I don't expect all buttons to be functional such as the 2nd or mode buttons. I've replaced some buttons and functions that are only operational in 2nd with the original buttons
on the calculator. Additionally, I have corrected the functionality for the % button and am working on the functionality of the inverse trig functions and the exponential function
(e^x) button.
